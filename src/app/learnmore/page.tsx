        Classify is a collaborative platform built for students who want a safe
        and supportive space to connect with classmates. Whether you're looking
        to ask a question, share notes, or simply talk through an assignment,
        Classify makes it easy to engage with others in your classes. It was
        designed with the understanding that approaching people in person can
        sometimes feel intimidatingâ€”especially in large or unfamiliar
        environments. With Classify, you don't have to worry about breaking the
        ice; you're already in a space where everyone shares the same goal:
        learning and helping one another. From casual discussions to exam prep,
        Classify brings the classroom community to your fingertips.
